##  Introduction 

This is the READ.ME of the project  "Interactive Wall" which was created as a part of the coursework. This will contain information about the project, the requirements, the software used and the hardware implemented. It will also go over the team-members and their diverse roles in the projetc.

## Discription
The interactive wall is a wall with tiles that are touch sensitive using the capacitive touch sensing technology of the Bare Conductive Touch board. Each tile has its own output sound that comes from a speaker. The project contains a Animal-soundbord and a Piano-soundbord.

## installation

The project works with a plug-and-play concept, which makes it user-friendly and easy to modify and expaned. 

To modify/change the audiofiles that play after an input requires an ssd-adapter. 

After the ssd is plugged in, you upload the desired audiofiles on to the ssd. The files should be named after their respected input. For example: If you desire that "sound_1" will play after the "input 2 is triggered", then the name of the audiofile should change to "002".
