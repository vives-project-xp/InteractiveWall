# What is the interactive wall?

The interactive wall is a wall with tiles that are touch sensitive using the capacitive touch sensing technology of the Bare Conductive Touch board. Each tile has its own output sound that comes from a speaker.

##  Introduction 

This is the READ.ME of the project  "Interactive Wall" which was created as a part of the coursework. This will contain information about the project, the requirements, the software used and the hardware implemented. It will also go over the team-members and their diverse roles in the projetc.

## Description
The interactive wall is a wall with tiles that are touch sensitive using the capacitive touch sensing technology of the Bare Conductive Touch board. Each tile has its own output sound that comes from a speaker. The projetc contains a Animal-soundbord and a Piano-soundbord.

## Bare Conductive Touch board
The Bare Conductive Touch board is a capacitive touch sensing board that can be used to turn any conductive material into a touch sensor. The board can be programmed to output different sounds when the electrodes are touched. The board can be programmed using the Arduino IDE.

We will use this board to make our project. With connectors we will connect the images on our board with the touch board. When the images are touched, the board will output a sound.

## Installation and Usage
Using the Bare Conductive Touch Board is v ery easy. You can use it straight out of the box. Just plug it in and you are ready to go. You can choose the sounds you want to play using the SD-card. The sounds will then play when the electrodes are touched. 


## Software
We will use Arduino IDE to program the Touch Board. Most of the default program will be used. But there are a few things that need extra programming. The Touch Board uses a lot of library so this provides a lot of abstraction, thus making it easier for us to program.


## Hardware
For hardware the microcontroller will be used. We also use a AC/DC Power adapter to supply our microcontroller and speaker. They both work on 5V.
