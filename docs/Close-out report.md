# Close-out Report

## Project Summary

The project delivered what it was supposed to, was delivered on time and was within budget. A working soundsboard/wall that uses the Bare Conductive Touch Board to play sounds when touched.

The project also delivered a proof-of-concept of a replica of the Bare Conductive Touch bord, using the ESP32. With the ESP32 we made a piano. Because this is a proof-of-concept, the "piano" doesn' play a sound, but light the LED's on, to show off the conductivity of the piano and functionality of the ESP32.
## Finale schedule and cost

## General Information

The Bare Conductive Touch bord is very buggy. The microcontroller is very sensitive to change, which has hold us back from making progression.
